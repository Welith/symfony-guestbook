# symfony-guestbook
A newbie PHP project, created to get familiar with symfony5.
## Usage
In order to run the local project, you need to clone the repo, have composer installed as well as the symfony cli. When these are all present on your PC, then all you need to do is run `symfony server:start` and you should be able to see the site on your localhost.
